## Tech Rationalist Portfolio Website

### Description

I've been contemplating creating my portfolio website for some time, and I finally decided to bring it to life. Instead of using more common technologies like *Next.js* or *Svelte*, I chose to learn and build with *Elixir* and *Phoenix*. This project serves as both my portfolio and a hands-on learning experience with these technologies.

While there are many examples of portfolio websites using other tech stacks, I found few that showcase *Elixir* and *Phoenix*. This motivated me to create a unique portfolio website as a practical exercise. One of the challenges I faced was integrating real-time features using *Phoenix LiveView*, which has significantly enhanced my understanding of real-time web applications.

The website is still a work in progress and will be updated as I complete more projects. My primary focus has been on functionality rather than UI design. If you have design skills, I'd appreciate any feedback or assistance to enhance the UI.

### Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Elixir
- Phoenix
- LiveView
- PostgreSQL

### Deployment

This website is deployed on [fly.io](https://fly.io/). I chose fly.io for its simplicity and ability to easily deploy and manage Elixir applications. Additionally, it provides excellent support for PostgreSQL, ensuring a reliable and performant database solution.

### GitHub URL

You can view the code and contribute to the project on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/techrationalist/portfolio).

### Database

I am using *PostgreSQL* as the database for this project. PostgreSQL is known for its robustness, scalability, and support for advanced data types and performance optimization features. It fits well with the requirements of a portfolio website and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

### Personal Note

Building this portfolio has been an exciting journey. I've enjoyed exploring the capabilities of Elixir and Phoenix and look forward to continuously improving the site. Your feedback on both the design and functionality is highly valued. Feel free to reach out with any suggestions or improvements.
